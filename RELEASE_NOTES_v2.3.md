# AutoLlama v2.3 Release Notes
**Release Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Code Name**: "Flowing Streams"

## üåä Major Flow View Overhaul

### Flow View Performance Fixes
- **Fixed Stalling Issue**: Resolved the critical bug where blocks would stall at ~20% progress and restart
- **Smooth Animation Flow**: Implemented deterministic lane-based object positioning to prevent clustering
- **Frame Rate Optimization**: Added 60fps frame limiting and timing guards for consistent performance
- **Memory Management**: Introduced object lifecycle management with 30-second lifetime limits and 50-object maximum

### Animation System Improvements
- **SSE Event Batching**: Implemented 100ms event batching to prevent animation interruption from real-time updates
- **Lane-Based Positioning**: Objects now flow in organized lanes instead of random positioning
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added creation timestamps for proper object lifecycle tracking
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of off-screen objects and expired animations

## üöÄ Technical Improvements

### Frontend Architecture
- **FlowingDashboard.jsx Refactoring**: Complete overhaul of the animation engine
  - Deterministic reset logic prevents object clustering
  - Batched SSE updates reduce render interruptions
  - Enhanced object lifecycle management
  - Improved memory efficiency

### Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced CPU Usage**: Frame rate limiting prevents unnecessary rendering
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup of animation frames and timers
- **Event Processing**: Batched real-time events for smoother UI updates
- **Object Limits**: Intelligent object count management prevents performance degradation

## üîß System Stability

### Animation Engine
- **Consistent Flow Speed**: Objects maintain steady velocity without stalling

- ‚úÖ Fixed memory leaks from uncleaned event listeners
- ‚úÖ Resolved frame rate inconsistencies
- ‚úÖ Improved responsiveness during heavy processing

## üîÑ Upgrade Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is a backward-compatible release

### Recommended Actions
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Force refresh to load updated Flow View component
2. **Test Flow View**: Verify smooth animation behavior in the "Flow View" tab
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check improved CPU and memory usage during processing

## üéØ What's Next

### Planned for v2.4
- Enhanced processing visualization with stage-specific animations
- Interactive flow control (pause, speed adjustment, filtering)
- Advanced object types for different processing stages
- Performance metrics dashboard for animation monitoring

## üìà Performance Metrics
