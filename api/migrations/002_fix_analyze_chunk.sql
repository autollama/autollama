-- Migration: Fix analyzeChunk Function Call Issue
-- Date: 2025-09-01
-- Purpose: Record that the analyzeChunk function fix has been applied
-- This migration doesn't run SQL - it just tracks that the code fix was applied

-- This migration indicates that server.js has been patched to use
-- services.analysisService.analyzeChunk() instead of the removed analyzeChunk() function

SELECT 'analyzeChunk function call fix applied' as status;
