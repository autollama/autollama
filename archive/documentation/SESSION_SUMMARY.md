# Session Summary - July 26, 2025

## Overview
Successfully resolved critical performance issues in AutoLlama.io application. The primary problem was 2-minute loading times caused by Airtable API rate limiting and incorrect field references, which has been completely fixed.

## Key Problems Solved
1. **Airtable 422 Errors**: Root cause was using `{Created Time}` field that doesn't exist - fixed by changing to `{Date Processed}`
2. **Performance Issues**: Eliminated 2+ minute loading times, now achieving ~1 second response times
3. **Real Data Integration**: Replaced fallback dummy data with actual Airtable records (50+ records loading successfully)
4. **Smart Caching Architecture**: Implemented hybrid system with real-time recent data (24h) + cached historical data

## Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `/home/chuck/homelab/autollama/api/database.js` - Updated field references and formulas
- **API Endpoints Working**: `/api/recent-records`, `/api/in-progress`, `/health`
- **Network**: Application runs on Tailscale VPN at `100.113.173.55:80` (not localhost:8080)
- **Search Functionality**: Client-side filtering working properly with real data

## Current State
- ✅ API returning 50+ real Airtable records in ~1 second
- ✅ No more 422 errors in logs
- ✅ Smart caching layer operational
- ✅ Frontend search functionality working
- ✅ In-progress tracking functional

## User Requirements Met
- **Real-time data**: Recent uploads (24h) fetched fresh from Airtable
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times vs original 2+ minutes
- **Fresh engagement**: Users see new content immediately
- **Historical access**: Older content cached for performance

## Technical Architecture
```
Frontend (Nginx:80) → API (Node.js:3001) → Airtable + PostgreSQL
    ↓
Tailscale Network (100.113.173.55:80)
    ↓  
Smart Caching: Recent (real-time) + Historical (1h TTL)
```

## Next Session Notes
- All performance issues resolved
- Real Airtable integration working
- If user reports new issues, check container logs with `docker compose logs autollama-api`
- PostgreSQL migration ready for future scaling if needed
- Environment variables properly configured in `.env`

## Key Success Metrics
- **Response Time**: 2+ minutes → ~1 second (99.2% improvement)
- **Data Source**: Dummy fallback → 50+ real Airtable records
- **Error Rate**: Continuous 422 errors → Zero errors
- **User Experience**: Timeouts/failures → Instant loading
