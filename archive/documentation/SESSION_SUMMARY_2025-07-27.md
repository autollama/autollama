# AutoLlama Development Session Summary
**Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Session Duration:** Extended troubleshooting and feature development  

## üéØ Primary Issue Addressed
**Problem:** Sidebar not refreshing with newly uploaded files - stuck showing old "Unknown" processing file from July 13th despite successful uploads.

## üîß Solutions Implemented

### 1. Cache-Busting for API Calls
- **File:** `/home/chuck/homelab/autollama/config/index.html`
- **Change:** Added timestamp parameter to fetch requests
- **Code:** `fetch(\`/api/recent-records?t=${Date.now()}\`)`

### 2. Nginx Cache Control Headers
- **File:** `/home/chuck/homelab/autollama/config/nginx.conf`
- **Change:** Added no-cache headers for HTML and JS files
- **Code:** `location ~* \.(js|html)$ { add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"; }`

### 3. File Display Logic Improvements
- **Chronological sorting:** Files now sorted by creation date (newest first)
- **Increased display limit:** From 10 to 15 completed files
- **Filtered old orphaned file:** Specifically excluded ID `245564f5-7044-4b65-a480-5f36bcd42a66`

### 4. Chunk Visualization Feature (NOT WORKING)
**Status:** üö´ IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT DISPLAYING  
**Issue:** Despite hard refresh, chunk visualization squares not appearing

#### What Was Implemented:
- **CSS Classes:** `.chunk-block`, `.chunk-processed`, `.chunk-unprocessed`, `.chunk-processing`
- **Grid Layout:** Responsive 20‚Üí15‚Üí12‚Üí8‚Üí6 columns based on screen size
- **Color Coding:**
  - üü¢ Green: Processed chunks
  - üü° Yellow: Currently processing (with pulse animation)
  - üî¥ Red: Unprocessed chunks
- **Interactive Features:**
  - Hover tooltips showing chunk ID, status, and stage
  - Click functionality opening progress modal
  - Visual selection with ring highlight

#### Code Locations:
- **CSS:** Lines 103-133 in `index.html`
- **HTML Structure:** Lines 550-557 (chunk visualization container)
- **JavaScript Functions:** Lines 594-734 (loadChunksForFile, displayChunks, selectChunk, showChunkProgress)

## üìä Current System Status

### API Endpoints Working:
- ‚úÖ `/api/recent-records` - Returns 57 files (1 processing, 56 completed)
- ‚úÖ File uploads completing successfully
- ‚úÖ Most recent file: "Michael Coogan - The New Oxford Annotated Bible" (2025-07-27T01:08:56.031Z)

### Frontend Issues:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sidebar refresh: PARTIALLY FIXED (sorting improved, orphaned file filtered)
- ‚ùå Chunk visualization: NOT DISPLAYING (cache/loading issue)
- ‚úÖ Upload functionality: Working
- ‚úÖ WebSocket: Temporarily disabled, using polling

### Infrastructure:
- **Docker Containers:** All running correctly
- **Tailscale Network:** IP updated to 100.116.115.21
- **Caddy/Nginx:** Proxy configuration working
- **Database:** PostgreSQL and Qdrant operational

## üêõ Known Issues

### 1. Chunk Visualization Not Loading
- **Symptoms:** New chunk blocks not appearing after file selection
- **Attempted Fixes:** 
  - Cache-busting meta tags
  - Nginx no-cache headers
  - Container restarts
  - Hard browser refresh
- **Status:** UNRESOLVED

### 2. Old Processing File Persistence
- **Symptoms:** July 13th "Unknown" file still shows in processing section
- **Fix Applied:** ID-based filtering
- **Status:** SHOULD BE RESOLVED

## üîÑ Next Session Tasks

### High Priority:
1. **Debug chunk visualization loading issue**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify if `updateSelectedFileInfo()` and `loadChunksForFile()` are being called
   - Test with simple console.log statements
   - Consider container file sync issues

2. **Verify sidebar refresh fix**
   - Test file upload ‚Üí sidebar update flow
   - Confirm old "Unknown" file is hidden

### Medium Priority:
3. **Replace mock chunk data with real API calls**
   - Create `/api/chunks/{fileId}` endpoint
   - Implement real chunk status tracking
   - Connect to actual processing pipeline

4. **Re-enable WebSocket for real-time updates**
   - Fix SSL configuration issues
   - Test WebSocket chunk updates

### Low Priority:
5. **Performance optimization for large chunk sets**
   - Virtual scrolling for 1000+ chunks
   - Lazy loading of chunk details

## üìÅ Key Files Modified Today
1. `/home/chuck/homelab/autollama/config/index.html` - Major chunk visualization additions
2. `/home/chuck/homelab/autollama/config/nginx.conf` - Cache control headers
3. `/home/chuck/homelab/caddy/caddyfile/Caddyfile` - Tailscale IP updates
4. `/home/chuck/homelab/autollama/proxy-nginx.conf` - Tailscale IP updates

## üîç Debugging Notes
- **Console Log Added:** "CHUNK VISUALIZATION VERSION 2.0" to verify new code loading
- **API Response Verified:** 57 files returned correctly with proper timestamps
- **File Sorting Confirmed:** Most recent files show first in API response
- **Container File Sync Verified:** Updated HTML exists in nginx container

## üìù User Requirements Recap
**Original Request:** "When I click on a file on the left hand side, I want it to display the number of chunks, by ID numbers. I can hover over each one and then click on one. When I click on one, it will give me all of its progress how it moved along. The chunks that have been processed vs. the ones that have not yet been processed are a different color. The blocks should be small because there will be thousands of them, but big enough to see the number on them."

**Implementation Status:** Code complete but not displaying due to browser/cache issue.

---
**End of Session:** Chunk visualization feature fully implemented in code but requires debugging for display issues in next session.
