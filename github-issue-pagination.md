# GitHub Issue: Missing Pagination Controls on Document Grid View

**Title:** Missing Pagination Controls on Document Grid View

**Labels:** bug, ui, pagination, frontend

**Priority:** Medium

---

## Issue Summary
After implementing the responsive grid layout for document tiles on the front page, the pagination controls are not visible in the browser, making it impossible to navigate through all 1608 documents.

## Current Behavior
- Document tiles display correctly in a responsive grid layout (2-6 columns based on viewport)
- Grid wraps properly and fills the page
- Only the first set of documents (approximately 10-24 tiles) are visible
- No pagination controls appear at the bottom of the page
- Unable to access remaining documents beyond the first page

## Expected Behavior
- Pagination controls should appear at the bottom of the document grid
- Controls should include: `< 1 2 3 4 5 ... last_page >`
- Previous/Next arrows for navigation
- Current page should be highlighted
- Users should be able to navigate through all 1608 documents

## Additional Context
- Total document count: 1608 (shown in stats)
- Console shows multiple 502 errors and CORS issues which may be interfering
- Grid layout enhancement is otherwise working correctly
- The pagination component may exist in code but is not rendering
- Recent attempts to fix the issue by updating pagination conditions have not resolved the visibility problem

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to AutoLlama front page
2. Observe document tiles display in grid format
3. Scroll to bottom of page
4. Note absence of pagination controls

## Priority
Medium - Users cannot access majority of documents without pagination

## Suggested Fix
- Check if pagination component is conditionally rendered based on failing API calls
- Ensure pagination renders independently of backend service status
- Verify pagination state management is properly initialized
- Add fallback logic to display pagination even with partial data
- Investigate if there are CSS issues hiding the pagination controls
- Debug the React component tree to confirm pagination component is mounting

## Technical Details
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
- API returns pagination metadata with total: 1608 documents
- Current limit: 20 documents per API call
- Grid displays 10-24 tiles depending on viewport size
- Issue persists after recent code changes to pagination logic
