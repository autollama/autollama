# AutoLLama.io Development Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the AutoLLama.io frontend and outlines the current known issues and next steps.

## Implemented Features:

*   **Real-time "In Progress" Updates:** The "In Progress" page now dynamically updates every 2 seconds, showing the current processing status of files.
*   **Whimsical Status Messages:** The "In Progress" items display funny and engaging status messages (e.g., "Wrangling data llamas...") instead of static timestamps.
*   **Debugging Alert Removed:** The debugging alert "File tab clicked! This proves clicking works." has been successfully removed from the file upload section.
*   **"Recent" Renamed to "Search":** The "Recent" navigation item and corresponding view have been renamed to "Search."
*   **Real-time Search Functionality:** A search bar has been added to the "Search" view, allowing users to filter records in real-time by title, URL, or summary.
*   **Dynamic "Recent Submissions" Sidebar:** A new section in the left navigation bar displays recent submissions, grouped by time ("Today," "Yesterday," "Last Week," "Previous 30 Days").
*   **Color-Coded Status Indicators (Sidebar):** Each recent submission in the sidebar shows a small color indicator (yellow for processing, green for complete).
*   **Hidden Sidebar Scrollbar:** The sidebar's scrollbar is now hidden for a cleaner aesthetic, while still allowing content to be scrolled.
*   **Subtle Selected Item Highlight (Sidebar):** The currently selected item in the sidebar is subtly highlighted with a purple theme.

## Current Known Issues:

*   ~~**"Search" View Loading Issue:** The "Search" view currently displays "Loading records..." indefinitely and does not correctly return or display search results.~~ **FIXED** - The API was limiting results to 20 records, now returns all deduplicated records.

## Recently Fixed:

*   **API Record Limit:** Modified `/api/recent-records` endpoint to return all deduplicated records instead of limiting to 20. The API now successfully returns 14 unique records.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Verify Functionality:** Thoroughly test all implemented features, especially the real-time updates, search, and sidebar functionality, to ensure they are working as expected.
2.  **Address Rate Limiting:** The Airtable API is experiencing rate limiting (429 errors) when the sidebar tries to fetch individual records too frequently. Consider implementing caching or throttling for these requests.
