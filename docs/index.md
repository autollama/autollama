# AutoLlama

AutoLlama is a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that understands document context rather than just isolated text chunks. Built with a JavaScript-first stack, AutoLlama deploys in seconds and gives you full control over your infrastructure.

## Features

- **Contextual retrieval** powered by Anthropic's research so responses follow the narrative of your documents.
- **One-command deploy** using Docker Compose for a complete RAG stack.
- **JavaScript-first architecture** for easy customization and extension.
- **Open source freedom** under the MIT license.
